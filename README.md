# Calibrated_Classification
This personal repo is to learn more about calibrating classifiers, using multi methods, as well testing VennABERS for calibration, and different visualization tools.

**Note:** The code use for VennABERS calibration belong originally to this [github repo.](https://github.com/ptocca/VennABERS/blob/master/VennABERS.py) 

*Note* Also I'm using the code from this [github repo.](https://github.com/ianozsvald/dtype_diet/blob/master/dtype_diet.py), to optimize the use of memory in my dataframes.
